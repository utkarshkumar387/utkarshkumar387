<p>
I'm a Software Engineer II at Peliqan, currently building Skindr — a platform revolutionizing dermatology by making expert skin care more accessible and efficient.<br><br>

Working with a Belgium-based startup, I help build a platform where users receive a diagnosis and customized treatment plan — including prescriptions — from a personal dermatologist, usually within 48 hours. Skin problems? We fix them faster than you can say “pimple popper.”<br><br>

I’m passionate about scalable tech solutions and specialize in Flutter & full-stack development, making sure apps run smoothly and users stay happy.<br><br>

I mostly speak Flutter and Firebase, sometimes mumble in Node.js and React. Git is my old friend — we've had our battles (merge conflicts, anyone?), but we always patch things up.<br><br>

I don’t just build apps — I raise them. I’ve argued with bugs at 3 AM and high-fived successful builds at 3:01.<br><br>

Some call it software engineering. I call it “fixing things I broke yesterday… but elegantly.”<br><br>

Tech, product, business — sabka dost, sabka coder.<br><br>

Still figuring out life. But for now, Ctrl + S is my therapy.
