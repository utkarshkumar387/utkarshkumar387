<p>
I'm a Software Engineer II at Peliqan, currently building Skindr — yes, it's as cool as it sounds, and no, it’s not a dating app for dermatologists (or is it?).<br><br>

I mostly talk in Flutter and Firebase, sometimes mumble in Node.js and React. Git is my old friend — we’ve had our fights (especially during merge conflicts), but we always patch things up.<br><br>

I don't just build apps — I raise them. From their first crash to their first successful API call, I've seen them grow. I’ve argued with bugs at 3 AM and high-fived successful builds at 3:01.<br><br>

People call it “software engineering.” I call it “fixing things I broke yesterday… but elegantly.”<br><br>

Behind all the tech, there's a guy who just loves building things that work — fast, clean, and with a sprinkle of "yaar, yeh toh mast ban gaya." Whether it's startups, side projects, or shipping MVPs that barely survived the deadline — I’m in for the hustle.<br><br>

Tech, product, business — sabka dost, sabka coder.<br><br>

Still figuring out life. But for now, Ctrl + S is my therapy.
